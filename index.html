        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Background / Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) utilizes data to
          shape future urban and transportation planning. The San Diego region
          stands as a burgeoning and dynamic hub for both living and working. In
          response to this growth, policy makers and regional planners at SANDAG
          have diligently utilized diverse data sources to create employment
          centers, crucial for informing future urban and transit planning
          endeavors. Traditionally, these employment centers have been defined
          as areas showcasing high concentrations of employment opportunities.
          However, there exists a need to enhance existing processes by
          incorporating additional data sources. Activity centers, defined as
          areas where different categories of businesses in San Diego tend to be
          located, offer a broader perspective for understanding the region's
          economic dynamics. These refined centers will not only be indicative
          of employment opportunities but also offer a holistic representation
          of the diverse activities characterizing their respective areas.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SANGIS Data:</strong> Comprises coordinates and categories
            of over 93,000 individual businesses within San Diego county.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>U.S. Census Bureau Data:</strong> Provides insights into
            employee commuting patterns and breaks down San Diego regions into
            tracts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SANDAG Open Data Portal:</strong> Offers a wide variety of
            data assets and unique data products within the region.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <h3>Categorization</h3>
        <p>Business types were binned into four main categories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Healthcare and Welfare</li>
          <li>Construction and Manufacturing</li>
          <li>Professional and Financial</li>
          <li>Retail and Services</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Hex-bin Approach</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Hexagonal Bins:</strong> Aggregate business-level data into
            hex-bins to quantify the density of businesses, identifying areas of
            high concentration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identify Activity Centers:</strong> Identify 70 hex-bins
            with the highest business density.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Distance Clustering:</strong> Apply distance clustering to
            assign remaining businesses to the hex-bins.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Census Tract Approach</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilize Business Sites Data:</strong> Find n (e.g., 70)
            number of clusters with k-means using business sites data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilize New Clusters:</strong> Use the new clusters to merge
            existing geometries of Census Tract data, forming new geometries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flatten Overlapping Groups:</strong> Use the geometries to
            flatten potentially overlapping groups and repeat the process with
            distance clustering.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>
          The outcome of our methodology is the identification of approximately
          70 Activity Centers across San Diego County, categorized by the
          dominant type of business activity. These centers enable the
          aggregation of summary statistics and the generation of detailed data
          visualizations, assisting in the exploration of business-employee
          interactions within the region. Our approach aligns with the
          objectives of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG),
          providing a foundational tool for urban planning and the development
          of public-facing documents that illustrate the economic landscape of
          San Diego County.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <h3>Comparative Analysis of Hexbin vs. Census Tract Methods</h3>
        <p>
          The hex-bin and census tract methodologies reveal similar
          concentrations of business clusters across San Diego, particularly
          within the health and welfare sector. Key areas such as La Jolla,
          Torrey Pines, and Sorrento Valley stand out as major hubs for the
          biotech industry and hospital locations. Although geo-spatial
          similarities exist between the two approaches, each comes with its own
          set of disadvantages and limitations.
        </p>
        <h3>Hexbin Approach</h3>
        <p>
          The hex-bin method minimizes biases associated with pre-existing
          boundaries, enabling a more nuanced understanding of spatial patterns.
          By organizing data into uniform hexagonal bins, it allows for the
          natural emergence of clusters based on data alone, without the
          constraint of traditional boundaries. This approach facilitates the
          discovery of clustering patterns unencumbered by external borders.
          However, its disregard for conventional boundaries can sometimes
          obscure analyses and make comparisons between different hex-bins
          challenging.
        </p>
        <h3>Census Tract Approach</h3>
        <p>
          In contrast, the census tract method aligns with pre-existing
          boundaries, incorporating natural and administrative demarcations such
          as freeways and other physical landmarks. This alignment aids in
          comparing clusters with detailed census tract and block-level
          employment data, enriching the clusters with socioeconomic contexts
          derived from employment datasets. Nonetheless, this method might
          produce overly large geometries in areas with sparse business data,
          potentially misrepresenting the actual distribution of economic
          activity.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          While both approaches offer valuable insights for the report's
          purposes, they prioritize different aspects of data representation.
          Hex-bins focus on an unbiased representation based on data-driven
          spatial patterns, whereas the census tract approach provides a
          contextually rich alignment with administrative boundaries, enhancing
          data comparability and socio-economic interpretation.
        </p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The methodology has limitations, notably in not adjusting for
            businesses' varying impacts based on size or significance. It treats
            all businesses equally, regardless of employee count or economic
            output, potentially missing key insights into economic activity
            distribution. Incorporating weighting schemes that reflect business
            size could provide a more accurate business activity representation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, the model's reliance on infrequently updated data,
            such as from the San Diego Geographic Information Source (SANDGIS),
            limits its currentness. A more dynamic and regularly updated data
            source, coupled with systematic data validation, could enhance the
            model's accuracy and relevance, ensuring a robust analytical
            framework.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Display weights onto certain business centers to accurately
            represent their density.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find more granular data sources to better represent the area with
            summary statistics.
          </li>
        </ol>
